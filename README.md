# Tracking GUI for bacteria and bacteria aggregates
This MatLab-based GUI is desired for tracking complicated objects, e.g., a bacteria aggregate. The user need to precompile "prcorr2" (downloadable from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4012-prcorr2-10-times-faster-correlation-coef) before using the GUI.

Copy every file to your working folder. To run the code, type "trackbackground" in a MatLab console.
